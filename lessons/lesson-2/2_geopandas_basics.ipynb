    "A **coordinate reference systems (CRS)** is a crucial piece of metadata for any\n",
    "geospatial data set. Without a CRS, the geometries would simply be a collection\n",
    "of coordinates in an arbitrary space. Only the CRS allows GIS software,\n",

    "\n",
    "Often conflated with coordinate reference systems, and definitely closely\n",

    "coordinate systems*, are mathematical models that allow us to transfer\n",
    "coordinates on the surface of our **three-dimensional Earth** into coordinates\n",
    "in a planar surface, such as a **flat, two-dimensional map**. In contrast to\n",
    "projected coordinate systems, *geographic coordinate systems* simply directly\n",
    "use latitude and longitude, i.e. the degrees along the horizontal and vertical\n",
    "great circles of a sphere approximating the Earth, as the x and y coordinates\n",
    "in a planar map. Finally, there are both projected and geographic coordinate\n",

    "in angles, distances, and areas simultaneously.\n",
